# Josephus-problem-Go
Solution of Josephus problem in Golang along with test cases.

In this Josephus simulator I am passing a array of players which is of data type PlayerProfile. PlayerProfile is defined in models.Go. To simulate the Josephus game i am iterating over the Players array till the value n(length of players array) is greater than 1 and consoling name of each player that is being eliminated in that round. The JosephusEliminator is retuning the Name of the player that survives.
